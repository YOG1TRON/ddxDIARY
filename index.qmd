## Greetings {#welcome}

Walcam to the ddxDIARY, written by none other than the Detective herself & deployed by the Lab's loyal [data dawg](https://github.com/YOG1TRON). If you have arrived here from one of Heart's foolish and absurdly-titled websites of pixel art and things she calls her "garden" or... "korok forest".... WHATEVER she denotes that tomfoolery these days... do NOT expect the same content to be presented in the ddxDIARY. 

_This..._ ddxDIARY... will hold the beginnings of our **endeavors** into the ddxCLUES. The very essence of differentials and disease combining hand-in-hand with the art of clue-unearthing will bring nothing less than the BEAUTY of our Laboratories. 
 
## What is the ddxDIARY?

I don't have the focking answers to everything, dude.
